            <lightning-accordion-section name="B" label="Q: What is the right age to buy health insurance?">
                <p class="sectionA slds-box slds-theme_shade"><b>Ans:</b> There is no right or wrong age to buy a health insurance policy. However, it is suggested to buy it as early as possible to keep your premium low. The earlier you buy health insurance, the lesser would be the premium because you have a lesser risk of health issues at a young age as compared to someone who is in their mid-50s or 60s as they are more prone to critical illnesses. Therefore, if you get health insurance in your 30s, you will be able to avail maximum insurance benefits that too at a lower premium.</p>
